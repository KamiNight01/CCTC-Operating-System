  use htop or --forest in ps-elf to check 
  
   when you're checing for persistance if it's not in the most basic stuff check in.  check bash.rc for bash profiles 
    as well as /etc/profiles.
    
PERSISTANCE:

    crontabs
   timers 
   /etc//bash/bash.rc      ---- systemwide file for interactive non login shells

 check these for  persistance to see if there's any script.
